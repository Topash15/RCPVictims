      <h2>
        SEC Charges Two Companies and Their Principals with Misleading Investors
        in More Than a Dozen Oil and Gas Securities Offerings
      </h2>
      <p>
        FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br />
        #2021-193 <br /><br />
        Washington D.C., Sept. 24, 2021 â€” <br />
        The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Thomas Powell and
        Stefan Toth, and their entities, Resolute Capital Partners LTD LLC and
        Homebound Resources LLC, with making material misrepresentations and
        omissions in connection with more than a dozen unregistered oil and gas
        securities offerings. Powell and Toth were also charged with acting as
        unregistered brokers. All respondents have agreed to settle the SEC
        action.
        <br /><br />
        According to the SEC's order, between 2016 and 2019, the respondents and
        salespeople acting on their behalf sold debt and equity securities to
        retail investors in unregistered offerings based on working interests in
        oil and gas wells. The order finds that the respondents made material
        misstatements and omitted material facts in both debt and equity
        offerings. In particular, the respondents provided insufficiently
        supported projections of future oil production, made statements about
        potential tax benefits that were unavailable to certain investors,
        overstated cash reserves, and made incomplete disclosures regarding
        potential uses of investor funds, including the amount of funds that
        would be used for payments to prior debt and equity investors. The order
        further finds that the respondents should have known that their
        statements and omissions were materially misleading.
        <br /><br />
        "Today's settlements provide important protections for investors,
        including prohibiting the respondents from participating in any oil and
        gas offerings for two years and requiring an independent compliance
        consultant to review policies, procedures, and offering materials for
        any further offerings for three years," said Carolyn M. Welshhans,
        Enforcement Division Associate Director. "Investors are entitled to
        materially accurate disclosures so they can make informed investment
        decisions."
        <br /><br />
        The SEC's order finds that the respondents violated the antifraud
        provisions and the registration provisions of the Securities Act of
        1933, and further that Powell and Toth acted as unregistered brokers.
        Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the respondents agreed
        to a cease and desist order and to undertakings that, among other
        requirements, prohibit them from participating in any unregistered oil
        and gas related offerings for two years, require them to post a
        referenced link to the SEC's order on all of their websites for three
        years, and require an independent compliance consultant for a period of
        three years. Powell and Toth also consented to collateral and penny
        stock bars and investment company prohibitions, with a right to apply
        for re-entry after two years. Finally, Resolute Capital and Homebound
        Resources each agreed to pay a civil penalty of $225,000, and Powell and
        Toth each agreed to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.
        <br /><br />
        The SEC's investigation was conducted by Brian Fitzsimons and Brian Vann
        with assistance from Joshua Braunstein, James Smith, Dean Conway, Jan
        Folena, Donald Furlano, and Deborah Russell. The investigation was
        supervised by Brian O. Quinn and Ms. Welshhans. The SEC appreciates the
        assistance of the Nevada Securities Division, the Securities Division of
        the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions, and the
        Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
